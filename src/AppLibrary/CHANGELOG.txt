- Updated changelog for v5.0.0 release.

v5.0.0

- Upgraded to .NET 8.0.
- Added entity and repository interfaces that default to using a GUID primary key and updated the abstract classes to 
  use these new interfaces.
- Breaking changes:
  - Uses of `EntityNotFoundException` will need to be updated to provide the class type. For example, 
    `EntityNotFoundException(typeof(MyEntity), id)` should be replaced with `EntityNotFoundException<MyEntity>(id)`.
  - References to `IEntity<Guid>` may need to be replaced with `IEntity`.
